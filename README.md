- Instagram account credentials

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   cd instagram-reel-auto-uploader
Install Required Libraries

Alternatively, you can install instagrapi directly:

Usage
Configure Your Script

Update the script with your Instagram credentials. For security, itâ€™s best to avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the code. Consider using environment variables.
